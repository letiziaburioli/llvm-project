# The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure

This directory and its sub-directories contain the source code for LLVM,
a toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers,
optimizers, and run-time environments.

The README briefly describes how to get started with building LLVM.
For more information on how to contribute to the LLVM project, please
take a look at the
[Contributing to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html) guide.

## Getting Started with the LLVM System

Taken from [here](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html).

### Overview
Welcome to Andi and Letizia's LLVM project!
The purpose of our project is to reproduce a CFI protection mechanism. We considered a situation in which during a program execution a function call is reached, the control is transferred to its routine and its instructions are executed. After the execution of the function code, the return instruction is supposed to let the execution flow go back to the address immediately after the function call. Our purpose is to ensure that the return address is the originally intended one, avoiding instruction flow modification from malicious attackers which could modify it thus provoking the execution of some potentially dangerous code. 

### Writing a new optimization pass for a RISCV Target Architecture
The RISCVCheckReturnAddr.cpp file containing our pass has been written in /Target/RISCV and added into the BUILD.gn file to include it in the compiler backend.

### How does our pass work 
Our optimization pass inserts two store instructions before any function call and before every return in the source code. The first one stores the return address contained in the register RISCV::X1 to the mailbox address (MailBoxAddr), whereas the second one is used to store an identifier in the following memory location (MailBoxAddr + 4 for RISCV32 and MailBoxAddr + 8 for RISCV64 architecture). The identifier allows to distinguish a call from a return and will be used by hardware entitled of making the comparison. 
    The pass also manages MailBoxAddr values greater than the 12 bits of the Immediate field, thanks to a LUI instruction (the sign extension automatically performed by the LUI is compensated).  


### Commands to build LLVM
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project/llvm 
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=RISCV  
cmake --build build  

### Run clang on an example file testFunction.c for a 64-bit RISCV architecture and observe the emitted IR in testFunction.bc
cd ..  
llvm/build/bin/clang -target riscv64-unknown-elf -O0 -S -emit-llvm testFunction.c -o testFunction.bc

### Run llc with our pass on testFunction.bc and specify the pass CLI options: -mailbox-offset allows the user to set a desired value 
### for MailBoxAddr, whereas -main-ret defines whether the pass should be applied also to the main function return or not.
llvm/build/bin/llc testFunction.bc -o - -mailbox-offset 10 -main-ret 1




----- DEFAULT README.md -----
The LLVM project has multiple components. The core of the project is
itself called "LLVM". This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header
files needed to process intermediate representations and convert them into
object files. Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and
bitcode optimizer. It also contains basic regression tests.

C-like languages use the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) frontend. This
component compiles C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ code into LLVM bitcode
-- and from there into object files, using LLVM.

Other components include:
the [libc++ C++ standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org),
the [LLD linker](https://lld.llvm.org), and more.

### Getting the Source Code and Building LLVM

The LLVM Getting Started documentation may be out of date. The [Clang
Getting Started](http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) page might have more
accurate information.

This is an example work-flow and configuration to get and build the LLVM source:

1. Checkout LLVM (including related sub-projects like Clang):

     * ``git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git``

     * Or, on windows, ``git clone --config core.autocrlf=false
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git``

2. Configure and build LLVM and Clang:

     * ``cd llvm-project``

     * ``cmake -S llvm -B build -G <generator> [options]``

        Some common build system generators are:

        * ``Ninja`` --- for generating [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)
          build files. Most llvm developers use Ninja.
        * ``Unix Makefiles`` --- for generating make-compatible parallel makefiles.
        * ``Visual Studio`` --- for generating Visual Studio projects and
          solutions.
        * ``Xcode`` --- for generating Xcode projects.

        Some common options:

        * ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS='...'`` and ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES='...'`` ---
          semicolon-separated list of the LLVM sub-projects and runtimes you'd like to
          additionally build. ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` can include any of: clang,
          clang-tools-extra, cross-project-tests, flang, libc, libclc, lld, lldb,
          mlir, openmp, polly, or pstl. ``LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES`` can include any of
          libcxx, libcxxabi, libunwind, compiler-rt, libc or openmp. Some runtime
          projects can be specified either in ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` or in
          ``LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES``.

          For example, to build LLVM, Clang, libcxx, and libcxxabi, use
          ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="libcxx;libcxxabi"``.

        * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=directory`` --- Specify for *directory* the full
          path name of where you want the LLVM tools and libraries to be installed
          (default ``/usr/local``). Be careful if you install runtime libraries: if
          your system uses those provided by LLVM (like libc++ or libc++abi), you
          must not overwrite your system's copy of those libraries, since that
          could render your system unusable. In general, using something like
          ``/usr`` is not advised, but ``/usr/local`` is fine.

        * ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=type`` --- Valid options for *type* are Debug,
          Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel. Default is Debug.

        * ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On`` --- Compile with assertion checks enabled
          (default is Yes for Debug builds, No for all other build types).

      * ``cmake --build build [-- [options] <target>]`` or your build system specified above
        directly.

        * The default target (i.e. ``ninja`` or ``make``) will build all of LLVM.

        * The ``check-all`` target (i.e. ``ninja check-all``) will run the
          regression tests to ensure everything is in working order.

        * CMake will generate targets for each tool and library, and most
          LLVM sub-projects generate their own ``check-<project>`` target.

        * Running a serial build will be **slow**. To improve speed, try running a
          parallel build. That's done by default in Ninja; for ``make``, use the option
          ``-j NNN``, where ``NNN`` is the number of parallel jobs to run.
          In most cases, you get the best performance if you specify the number of CPU threads you have.
          On some Unix systems, you can specify this with ``-j$(nproc)``.

      * For more information see [CMake](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html).
